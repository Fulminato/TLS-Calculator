# TLS-Calculator
The Tool is developed with the goal of being an all-inclusive hidden stats calculator, helping to keep track of all decision/hidden stats for tailoring the 'best' outcome one want for his playthrough. Near all the possibility are implemented, event the suboptimal one [for now there are very few exceptions for some technical problems in the implementation]. any activity without effect in the hidden stats or changing options in the future are omitted (a notable example is the "rick's Familiy" quest) or the extra loot you can obtain from various chests. The tool is still in beta because I don't think is the right shape for a '1.0' release, but all the feature are implemented and working (well, aside for the bugs), the tool lack some polishing (for example, remove Altina RP stamp if she isn't a party member), and there are some 'extra' feature can be implemented, but I am not sure if the gain is enough to compensate the extra works, for example a list for trin copied people and the list of investment at the end of each section. the tool features an option panel with some customization, show or hide the 'result box' for each section, the option to hide each RP value [a thing I want implement for the each country score, soon (c)], and the ability to choose between two 'version' for any chapter, the full version is, well, more verbose, but implement a full set of constraining in the thing can be or cannot be done in the game, the 'skipped' version [any advice for a better name is appreciated] try to reduce the number of inputs to the minimum, the two versions are the same in regard of choice and calculation. the calculator is an HTML page with JavaScript to handling all the works. It doesn't need any internet connection, external library or extra feature, the code is still crude, and my JS coding skill isn't great, any advice to improve the tool is really appreciated.
